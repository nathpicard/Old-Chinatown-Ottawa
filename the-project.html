	     <h1> Ottawa’s Old Chinatown: A Practice in Unwilling Collaboration </h1>
	     <h2> or "Is This Stealing?": An Attempt at Transparency</h2>
<hr>
<h3> The Assignment </h3> 
<p>At the beginning of the year, my digital history professor, Shawn Graham, walked into our classroom and told us that we were not enrolled in a traditional history course. “We’re going to be break things,” he said. “What you initially try to accomplish isn’t going to work. If you fail, that’s when you’re going to learn.” It was an intimidating, exciting start to the semester (and spoiler alert: He was right). Going on he instructed myself and my classmates to question the established narratives, disrupt the norm and intervene in a historical way. He expected us to produce projects that would cause others to do the same. <p>
<p> Over the first couple weeks we discussed the different avenues we could pursue in order to produce this disruption of history. We learned about pirate boxes (which, when one connects to their insular wifi, can offer downloadable material or an interactive website), game building software (like Aris, which allows you to build scavenger hunt like games using virtual items accessible through location GPS on your phone) , Augmented Reality (teaching our phone cameras to recognize images that would trigger new windows to open), and projection mapping. There is a very high likelihood that you’ve encountered projection mapping sometime in the past few years. This digital intervention creates images that can be projected onto irregular surfaces and while keeping their shape. Department stores use it for advertising campaigns, the government of Canada tells its national history with images projected onto Parliament, and guerilla artists project controversial images in public spaces to catch the eye of passers-by. <p>
<p> Projection Mapping appealed to me immediately. In my mind, its ephemeral quality pairs perfectly with the inherit accessibility of a publicly projected image. If someone was in the public space where I was projection mapping, there would be no barriers to them watching the production, and if the projection upset someone, the art would be gone the moment the projector was powered off. So, this was how my project started. I wanted to share a lesser-known history through images to broad public, and projection mapping was the tool to do so. Only… I didn’t know what history I wanted to tell. <p>

<h3>”Discovering” Ottawa’s Old Chinatown</h3>
<p> I’m new to Ottawa. I moved here for school eight months ago, and quickly familiarized myself with Somerset Street, starting in front of the beautiful welcome gate. Happily, I explored its restaurants, bubble tea shops and grocery stores. Although smaller than both Vancouver and Montreal’s Chinatowns, which I had become familiar with during my years living in each city, it had everything that I could ask for. <p>
<p> A long-time fan of historic Chinatowns, I decided to look into the history of Somerset Street, as a potential area to focus my projection mapping on. This is when I discovered that Chinese immigrants began establishing themselves along that street in the late 1960s. Before that, SFU’s <i>Chinese Canadian History Public Education Project</i> informed me, the hub of Ottawa’s Chinese community could be found on Albert Street between O’Connor and Kent. Curious about this “original Chinatown”, I ventured to Google Street view and discovered that the prominent Bell building that now runs along Albert features a wall that was virtually created for Projection Mapping. My plan was set in motion.<p>
	<div style="float: right;"><IMG SRC="https://github.com/nathpicard/Old-Chinatown-Ottawa/blob/gh-pages/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-12%20at%209.06.25%20PM.png?raw=true" style="margin-left:30px; margin-bottom; 30px;" width="500" height="400" alt="Albert-Street"> </div>	
<p>My search into the Old Chinatown yielded the main historical source for this project almost immediately- <i>Lives of the Family </i> is author Denise Chong’s recently published book on the first Chinese families who established themselves in the Ottawa Valley in the early decades of the 20th century. The book follows these families over generations, made rich with photographs and interviews with those family members. It was a wonderful launching point- but begged the question: Was I engaging with an already written history? Did I have anything to contribute to this history? <p>
<p> Talking with classmates and other friends from Ottawa, it became clear to me that the Chinese Community on Albert Street was still a relatively unknown part of Ottawa’s history. So, the history that I wanted to write would be based on location. It would feature businesses that although they closed decades ago, were staples of the early Chinese community. I would project images onto the side of the Bell building, and they would act as literal windows into the past- where those walking by would learn about the community that once walked the very streets that they were walking. Grounding my project on the businesses and the structures of the community would allow my project to stand as an independent exploration of the early Chinese community in Ottawa.<p> 
<hr>
<h3> Making a Website for the First Time</h3>
<p> I realized quickly that I wanted to make the website a companion to my projection mapping, in order to provide with concrete historical information about this historic neighbourhood. The concept for the website was also based on highlighting the location and businesses of Ottawa’s first Chinatown. Therefore, an old map of Ottawa and pinned with the historic businesses in their authentic location served as the foundation of the website. Clicking on each pin would reveal the address of the business, and a brief informative paragraph about said business. Then, I developed four webpages that you can click through to after this short snippet of information. They give broader information on the history of the different types of establishments- groceries, laundries, restaurants, and social clubs, that made up the majority of Chinese property in the early twentieth century. <p>
<p>The website would also create a permanent digital home for the projection mapping videos, thus making that piece of digital history accessible to all interested in it. Essentially, the website could be a hub to pull together all of information collected in working on this project. However, as Shawn had warned at the beginning of the course, over the course of building this project I  have been gaining information in a much more nuanced way than simply collecting research and conveying it through my own lens, as most masters students can essentially do in their sleep. I was learning about considerations such as who my audience would be; Who did I want my audience to be? How would readers who had a personal connection with this history react? How would citizens who work on Albert street perceive it? How much information would overwhelm or cause readers to lose interest? How could I portray my research in as balanced of a manner as possible? How could I challenge pre-conceptions held by readers from various communities? How can I tell this story with the authority gained from my research, while being cognisant of my position as an outsider to the community I am studying? <p>
<p> Simultaneous to conducting my research, I was also learning multiple new forms of media- specifically the projection mapping software <i>mapmap</i> and basic HTML for the development of this website. With digital experience that hit its limit at “I could google how to do that?”, I delved head first into creating the platform that was easily imagined, and less easily created. I learned how to re-purpose previously written code for my own site- to recognize what needed changing, adapting and what needed to stay to keep the site afloat. I learned to read through HTML message boards to find the code that best suited my purposes and learned not to try and fix HTML on a site that had content that I was already happy with, because it risked ruining the work that I had already accomplished. As Shawn had foretold, failure was exactly how I learned, especially when I had to fix those failings.<p>
<p> This is where I chronicle all those failures, and the occasional successes that followed. Both the ethical and methodological difficulties that I faced had direct impacts on the final product which you are accessing today. Therefore, for the sake of transparency, and potentially to help you out should you ever decide to undertake such a project, it is necessary that I address them.<p>
